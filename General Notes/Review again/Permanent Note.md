Chapter 5.2 

Assembly language is a low level programming language which is used for low level hardware communication (though not as low as machine code). The program written in assembly language would be translated to binary (machine code) using an assembler. 

Each manufacturer has a different assembly language and so it’s not shareable unlike high-level programming languages or machine code itself 

Machine code is the lowest form of hardware communication and is direct as it is written in ones and zeros which the computer doesn’t need to be translated. 
Each line of assembly language creates exactly one line of machine code. However, the same cannot be said for each line of high level language which creates multiple lines of machine code.

Stepping  -Single stepping, debugging one line at a time 
Con: Bad for debugging large number of lines 

Breakpoints – A debugger can also use breakpoints points in the code where the program can be stopped to see what is happening and check for errors 
A breakpoint can be created b the programmer to halt the program after a certain number of lines (nothing special, done by the programmer) 

Report window 
Pop-up window appears to list the errors in the code with information on the line numbers that contain the error and the type of error that has occurred and sometimes with some suggestions of how to resolve the error. 









IPv4
There are 4 parts separated by full stop’s (.), each of the part is 1 byte
Only binary can be used, and has a total combination of 4.3 billion addresses

IPv6
There are 8 parts, each separated by semicolons, with each of the part consisting of 2 bytes
Binary and hex can be used. 


Question A
256.256.256.256
IPv4 only has a possible combination f 4.3 billion addresses, so a better way was needed for the entire world of 8 billion devices.
It uses 16 bits instead of 8 bits for each of its parts, and separates the part using the semi-colons rather than using full stop’s  It also uses hex rather than just binary, 
+ It has 8 instead of 4 parts
